            <h2>🌟 About Iqsa</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Iqsa</strong> is a dedicated guidance website created to support BCA (Bachelor of Computer
                Applications) students by providing high-quality notes, useful projects, and exam preparation materials.

            <p>
                I’m <strong>Mohammed Sufiyan</strong>, a BCA student and passionate developer. I created Iqsa as a free
                and helpful platform to assist other BCA students like myself with easy access to study materials and
                project ideas.
            </p>
